# PawsForeverProject

Paws Forever Project is my first responsive web-app built with React Js! The concept is to connect people with local dogs and cats in their area in a
dating-app style matching process. Users will create a profile and add information about the kind of pet they would like to adopt as well as the kind
of lifestyle users have. Then, users will be able to swipe through pets that match their criteria and be able to favorite the ones they like. 

Pets will be given a basic bio that will display relevant information to users about the pet's health, gender, age, location, temperament and more as well as
links to the local shelther the pet is currently located at. 

Through the use of prompts, users will be asked if they were able to adopt any of the local dogs and cats that they were 'matched' with and provide feedback 
about the experience.
